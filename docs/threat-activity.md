Recently key high profile vulnerabilities this month worth staying across include:

- [Threat Actors Exploiting Citrix CVE-2023-3519 to Implant Webshells - 20230721002](https://soc.cyber.wa.gov.au//advisories/20230721002-Threat-Actors-Exploiting-Webshells-Citrix/)

- [Increase in QR Code Phishing Technique - 20230710003](https://soc.cyber.wa.gov.au//advisories/20230710003-QR-Code-Phishing-Increase/)

Agencies should review their software asset register(s) and vulnerability remediation (patching) processes to mitigate against the above vulnerabilities. Any exposed **remote access** services should be worth prioritising due to ongoing threat activity.
If you were affected by the **LastPass** breach last year, please take a look at this: [Experts Fear Crooks are Cracking Keys Stolen in LastPass Breach ](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/)

**Phishing activity remains high** across all organisations with multiple incidents detected weekly. Please refer to the below guides to ensure all external and internal sign-ins are appropriately monitored.
